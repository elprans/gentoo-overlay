	Argyll is an experimental, open source, ICC compatible color management system.
	It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, CMYK printers,
	film recorders and calibration and profiling of displays.
	Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of illuminants observer types,
	and paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation.
	Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual and saturation intents.
	Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model,
	a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of rendering intents.
	It also includes code for the fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere,
	as well as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion.
	Device color gamuts can also be viewed and compared using a VRML viewer.
