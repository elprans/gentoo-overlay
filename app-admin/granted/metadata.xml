		Granted is a command line interface (CLI) application which simplifies 
		access to cloud roles and allows multiple cloud accounts to be opened 
		in your web browser simultaneously.

		The goals of Granted are:

        * Provide a fast experience around finding and assuming roles
		* Leverage native browser functionality to allow multiple accounts 
		  to be accessed at once
		* Encrypt cached credentials to avoid plaintext SSO tokens being saved
		  on disk
